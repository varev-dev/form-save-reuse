## Problem to solve

<b><i>Problem</i></b>: <br>
Many websites have a time-consuming form that <i>may take several sessions to complete</i>. 
However, they do not offer <b>the option of saving content</b>, which then has to be hidden in txt files and pasted the next time. <br>

<b><i>Solution</i></b>: <br>

This will make this long and time-consuming process <b>more accessible and less tedious</b>.
